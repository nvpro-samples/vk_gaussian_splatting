![image showing the rendering modes on the train 3DGS model](doc/rendering_modes.jpg)

We envision this project as a **testbed** to explore and compare various approaches to real-time visualization of **3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [[Kerbl2023](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/)]** and related evolutions. By evaluating various techniques and optimizations, we aim to provide valuable insights into **performance, quality, and implementation trade-offs** when using the **Vulkan API**.

This sample implements several **rendering pipelines** based on **rasterization**, **ray tracing**, and **hybrid** approaches. For a good general understanding, we strongly recommend reading the following pages in order.

1. The present **readme.md**, will get you **up and running** with the software, point out where to **get sample scenes** and how to **open your first scene**. It also centralizes the bibliographic references for all the sub pages.
2. The [Vulkan Gaussian Splatting Overview](./doc/overview_of_vk_gaussian_splatting.md) page will drive you through the different elements of the user interface and the functionalities of the software. *Some important points are introduced in this page*.

    We then describe our Vulkan implementation of the rendering approaches:

## Building and Running

``` sh
# Clone the repository (use --recursive instead for git verison < 2.13)
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/nvpro-samples/vk_gaussian_splatting
cd vk_gaussian_splatting

# Configure 
cmake -S . -B build

# Alternatively, configure as follows to disable the default "bouquet of flowers"  
# scene download by CMake and prevent auto-loading in the sample
cmake -S . -B build -DDISABLE_DEFAULT_SCENE=ON

# Build
cmake --build build --config Release

# Run
./_bin/Release/vk_gaussian_splatting.exe [path_to_ply]

```

## Opening 3DGS PLY and SPZ Files

By default the application opens a 3DGS model representing a bouquet of flowers unless you disabled it at CMake stage. The sample application supports PLY files in the format introduced by INRIA [[Kerbl2023](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/)]. The sample also supports import of SPZ files as defined by [nianticlabs](https://github.com/nianticlabs/spz). PLY and SPZ files can be opened using any of the following methods:
* **Command Line** â€“ Provide the file path as last argument when launching the application.
* **File Menu** â€“ Use "File > Open" to browse and load a PLY or SPZ file.
* **Drag and Drop** â€“ Simply drag and drop the PLY or SPZ file into the viewport.

**Compatibility**
* [Jawset Postshot](https://www.jawset.com/) and [3DGRUT](https://github.com/nv-tlabs/3dgrut) output ply files are compatible with the INRIA format and can be opened directly.
* Other reconstruction software's ply outputs such as [NerfStudio](https://docs.nerf.studio/nerfology/methods/splat.html), [LichtFeld Studio](https://github.com/MrNeRF/LichtFeld-Studio) should also work.

* SPZ file import can be tested using the sample [models](https://github.com/nianticlabs/spz/tree/main/samples) provided by nianticlabs.

> **Important Note**: Visualization of 3D Gaussian models is most effective when using the same rendering algorithm and settings used during reconstruction. For example, models generated using Postshot 3DGS with anti-aliasing enabled will be best visualized using one of the available 3DGS pipelines (Mesh or Vertex) and by enabling "Mip Splatting Anti-Aliasing" in the rendering > rasterization parameters. Since no generic format with proper metadata exists, users must manually configure the rendering settings. Note that original 3DGS models from INRIA do not include anti-aliasing, which was introduced later [Yu2023].

## 3DGS Datasets

The INRIA dataset of pre-trained models is available for [download](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/datasets/pretrained/models.zip) from the INRIA server. 

* To visualize 3DGS reconstruction output, **open PLY files located in the point_cloud subfolders**, corresponding to 7,000 or 30,000 iterations.
* Attention: The **input.ply files cannot be loaded**, as they represent raw point clouds (not 3DGS) generated by Structure From Motion (SfM) during model reconstruction.

Additionally, you can download the [3D gaussian model of a place with a fountain in France](http://developer.download.nvidia.com/ProGraphics/nvpro-samples/fountain_place.zip) and [the 3DGS model of fountain Sindelfingen](http://developer.download.nvidia.com/ProGraphics/nvpro-samples/fountain_sindelfingen.zip), both by [3ds-scan (Christian Rochner)](https://3ds-scan.de/) and licensed under the [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license.

The Bouquet of Flowers scene, which is automatically downloaded by CMake, can also be [downloaded here](http://developer.download.nvidia.com/ProGraphics/nvpro-samples/flowers_1.zip). The model is released under the [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license.

Note: Even if not generated by 3DGRT or 3DGUT, the 3DGS bouquet of flowers and the two 3DGS fountain scenes from 3ds-scan will provide acceptable visual results when rendered using 3DGRT or 3DGUT with **Kernel degree** set to "2 (Quadratic)."

## 3DGRT Datasets

> **Attention**: The original version of the archive, named 3dgrt-mipnerf360-parametric-1M-v1.zip, was erroneously containing 3DGUT models. The archive has been renamed and updated with proper 3DGRT content.

We provide the reconstruction of the MipNerf 360 image set v1, using **3DGRT** with parametric particles intersections and MCCM/Adam, providing 1M splats for each model.

Download: [3dgrt-mipnerf360-v1-parametric-degree-4-mcmc-selective-adam-1M (1.5GB)](http://developer.download.nvidia.com/ProGraphics/nvpro-samples/3dgrt-mipnerf360-v1-parametric-degree-4-mcmc-selective-adam-1M.zip). 

Recommended visualization settings for the **3DGRT pipeline**:
* **Kernel degree**: 4 (Tesseractic)
* **Particle format**: AABB + parametric  

## 3DGUT Datasets

We provide the reconstruction of the MipNerf 360 image set v1, using **3DGUT** with MCCM/Adam, providing 1M splats for each model.

Download: [3dgut-mipnerf360-v1-mcmc-selective-adam-1M (1.5GB)](http://developer.download.nvidia.com/ProGraphics/nvpro-samples/3dgut-mipnerf360-v1-mcmc-selective-adam-1M.zip). 

Recommended visualization settings for the **3DGUT or hybrid 3DGUT+3DGRT pipelines**:
* **Mip splatting anti-aliasing**: Enabled  
* **Kernel degree**: 2 (Quadratic)  

## Profiling and Benchmarking

To properly assess the performance of the pipelines, you should **deactivate vertical synchronization (V-Sync)**. This can be done from the **View > V-Sync** menu, the **Renderer Properties** panel, or the **Profiler** window. If V-Sync is not deactivated, the system does not run at optimal performance, and the reported timings in the **Window Top Bar** and **Profiler** window are generally higher (and fps lower) than the achievable performance. The V-Sync option is enabled by default to save energy.

The system also provides a means to run automatic benchmarks, which are detailed in the **Performance Results** sections of the documentation sub-pages. In Benchmarking mode, V-Sync is automatically disabled.
